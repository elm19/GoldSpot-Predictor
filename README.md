# GoldSpot Predictor

GoldSpot Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the price movement of gold spot futures using both technical indicators and fundamental market data. The goal is to build a predictive model that helps traders make informed decisions based on historical trends and macroeconomic factors.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gather historical gold price data, economic indicators, and market sentiment.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Construct relevant technical and fundamental indicators.
- **Model Training**: Use machine learning algorithms to predict price movement.
- **Evaluation & Backtesting**: Assess model performance on historical data.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model via API or web interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Flask/FastAPI (for deployment)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elm19/goldspot-predictor.git
   cd goldspot-predictor
   ```
   
  
  
challenges: 
1 how would we evaluate our model in our case? we should no just consider it
